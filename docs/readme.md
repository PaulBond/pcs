For example, [click_me](http://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/) to go to the bootstrap tutorial provided by w3school.

## Adding images

To add an image to this folder, place the pic in the _img_ folder.  

![mvc image](img/mvc_pic.png)


Just look at this readme.md in a text editor to see the syntax.  Its very straight forward.
