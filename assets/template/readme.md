# Templates


## Usage
For now, use the templates folder as a playground and back up of code.  For example, say you are working on ar_dashboard and find a layout or functionality that would better suite the doc_dashboard.  Then, copy the code to a file here for later development.

## Naming convetion
Keep your name on the file.  As you can see, I have a file called cb_playgound.php.  I'm using this to get a feel for Bootstrap layout and CSS.

## Also Included
Of course, this file should keep code that is constantly being reused, see php_bootstrap.txt for example.  This is the bare bones used to create a webpage using php and bootstrap.
